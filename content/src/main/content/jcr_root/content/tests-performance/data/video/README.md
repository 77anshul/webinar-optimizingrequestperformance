Video Data Sample File
------------------------------------
For the purposes of testing, a large video file called 'big_buck_bunny_1080p_h264.mov' should be placed in this folder before installing the maven bundle.

If you wish to change the location and name of this file from above, you can edit the JMeter scripts to point to a different location, and also ensure that the VideoMetaDataServlet has the correct metadata for the file extension.
