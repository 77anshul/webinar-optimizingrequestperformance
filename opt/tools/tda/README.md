Thread Dump Scripts
------------------------------------
By following the instructions on the [CQ Thread Dump KB] article, you can get an insight into your running CQ application.

You can use a [Batch Thread Dump Script] such as the one linked here to gather a set of thread dumps over a set period of time.

Once you have these files, you can use a tool such as [Thread Dump Analyzer] to help you quickly get insight into the workings of the JVM at the time of taking the dumps.
